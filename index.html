<p>Iâ€™m Tian Jiang, a student studying computer engineering at University of Waterloo. My programming focus is to build a bridge between software and hardware. My main passion in life is to create efficient and valuable software products.</p>

<p>I have been dreaming to become a professional computer engineer for many years. I am concentrating on all things related to computer area these days, from the background science to front end testing. I find that studying computer engineering is interesting because I am learning new technologies that will change the world.</p>

<p>I know that the most important thing about engineer is not the knowledge you own but the passion you have.</p>
